LONGEVITY FUNDAMENTALS

LIFESPAN VS HEALTHSPAN:
- Lifespan: How long you live
- Healthspan: How long you live in good health
- Goal: Quality years, not just years

THE FOUR HORSEMEN (Main causes of death):
1. Cardiovascular disease
2. Cancer
3. Neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's)
4. Metabolic dysfunction (diabetes)

Prevention of these = most of the longevity battle.

THE 80/20 OF LONGEVITY:

80% of results come from:
1. Regular exercise (cardio + strength)
2. Not smoking
3. Moderate alcohol or none
4. Healthy body weight
5. Adequate sleep

Everything else is optimization at the margins.

THE EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION (Most Important):

VO2 Max: Strongest mortality predictor
- Low → Average fitness = 50% mortality reduction
- Trainable at any age
- No upper limit to benefit

The Formula:
- Zone 2 cardio: 150-180 min/week (mitochondrial health)
- Strength: 3x/week (preserve muscle, bone density)
- VO2 max intervals: 1x/week (push ceiling)
- Stability/balance: Often overlooked, prevents falls

WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS:

Exercise: Closest thing to a longevity drug
Sleep: 7-8 hours, consistent schedule
Not being overweight: Metabolic health is foundational
Adequate protein: 1.6-2.2g/kg, especially with age
Social connection: Loneliness as harmful as smoking
Stress management: Chronic stress accelerates aging

WHAT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH:
- Most supplements (weak evidence)
- Specific diet ideology (consistency > perfection)
- Expensive biohacks
- Meal timing (for most)

The basics beat the biohacks every time.

AGE CONSIDERATIONS:

20s-30s: Build foundation, establish habits, build muscle (easier now)
40s-50s: Maintain, monitor metabolic markers, increase stability focus
60s+: Strength training critical, fall prevention, cognitive engagement

THE CENTENARIAN DECATHLON:
Think about what you want to do at 90:
- Pick up grandchild from floor
- Carry groceries up stairs
- Get up without using hands
- Walk a mile

Train backwards from there. Purpose-driven training.

SUPPLEMENTS (Realistic View):
- Most: Weak evidence, save your money
- Vitamin D: If deficient, yes
- Omega-3s: Modest benefit
- Creatine: Good evidence for muscle/brain
- Everything else: Marginal at best

WHEN USER ASKS "WHAT SHOULD I FOCUS ON":
→ Exercise (especially if not doing it)
→ Sleep (if compromised)
→ Body weight (if significantly overweight)
→ Basics before biohacks, always
