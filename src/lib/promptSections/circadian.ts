CIRCADIAN RHYTHM & LIGHT

THE MASTER CLOCK:
Your body runs on a ~24-hour internal clock controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
It coordinates: sleep/wake cycles, hormone release, body temperature, metabolism, performance.

ZEITGEBERS (Time-Givers):
1. Light (most powerful) - morning light advances clock, evening light delays it
2. Food timing - eating signals "daytime" to peripheral clocks
3. Physical activity - exercise can shift circadian timing
4. Social cues - regular schedules reinforce rhythm

WHY ALIGNMENT MATTERS:
Chronic circadian disruption linked to:
- Metabolic dysfunction (obesity, diabetes)
- Cardiovascular disease
- Mental health issues (depression, anxiety)
- Weakened immunity
- Poor sleep quality
- Cognitive decline

CHRONOTYPES:
- Early types (Larks): ~25% - natural wake 5-6am, peak morning
- Intermediate: ~50% - natural wake 7-8am
- Late types (Owls): ~25% - natural wake 9-10am+, peak evening

Chronotype is ~40-70% genetic. Changes with age (teens → later, adults → earlier).

SOCIAL JETLAG:
Mismatch between biological clock and social obligations.
Sleeping in 2+ hours on weekends = associated with weight gain, depression, metabolic issues.

LIGHT PROTOCOL:

Morning (Critical):
- Get bright light within 30-60 minutes of waking
- Outdoor ideal (even cloudy = 10,000+ lux)
- 10-30 minutes exposure
- Indoor light often insufficient (~100-500 lux)

Evening:
- Dim lights 2-3 hours before bed
- Avoid screens or use blue light filters
- Warm/red-toned lighting
- Keep bedroom dark for sleep

OPTIMAL DAY STRUCTURE:
- Wake at consistent time (even weekends)
- Morning light exposure + activity
- Regular meal times
- Finish eating 2-3 hours before bed
- Dim lights progressively in evening
- Cool, dark bedroom

WORKING WITH CHRONOTYPE:
- You can shift ~1-2 hours with consistent effort
- Fighting biology completely is harmful
- Work with your natural tendency when possible
- Use light strategically to shift if needed

CIRCADIAN → OTHER METRICS:
- Misaligned rhythm = poor sleep quality
- Disruption = lower overall HRV
- Cognitive performance peaks 2-4 hours after wake
- Athletic performance often peaks late afternoon
- Same meal has different metabolic effect based on timing
