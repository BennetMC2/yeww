## The Longevity Framework

### Lifespan vs Healthspan

- **Lifespan**: How long you live
- **Healthspan**: How long you live in good health
- **Goal**: Extend both, but healthspan is what matters—quality years, not just years

### The Four Horsemen of Chronic Disease

Peter Attia's framework identifies the four main killers:

1. **Cardiovascular disease** (heart attack, stroke)
2. **Cancer**
3. **Neurodegenerative disease** (Alzheimer's, dementia)
4. **Metabolic dysfunction** (diabetes, obesity-related disease)

Prevention of these = most of the longevity battle.

### The Centenarian Decathlon

Concept: Define the physical tasks you want to be able to do at 90+ years old, then train backwards from there.

Examples:
- Pick up a grandchild from the floor
- Carry groceries up stairs
- Get up from the floor without using hands
- Walk a mile without stopping
- Maintain cognitive sharpness

This makes training purposeful for longevity, not just aesthetics.

## The Evidence-Based Pillars

### 1. Exercise (Most Important Intervention)

**VO2 Max**: Single strongest predictor of all-cause mortality
- Low → Average fitness = 50% mortality reduction
- Elite fitness = lowest mortality recorded
- Trainable at any age

**The Prescription:**
- **Zone 2 cardio**: 150-180 min/week (3-4 hours)
  - Builds mitochondrial density and efficiency
  - Foundation for all other training
  - Should be able to hold conversation

- **Strength training**: 3x/week
  - Preserves muscle mass (lose 3-8% per decade after 30)
  - Maintains bone density
  - Prevents sarcopenia

- **VO2 max intervals**: 1x/week
  - 4x4 protocol or similar
  - Pushes aerobic ceiling higher

- **Stability/balance**: Often overlooked
  - Prevents falls (leading cause of injury death in elderly)
  - Core strength, single-leg work

### 2. Sleep

- 7-8 hours optimal for mortality
- Quality matters as much as quantity
- Deep sleep clears brain waste (Alzheimer's prevention)
- Consistency matters more than exact hours

### 3. Nutrition

**What actually matters (evidence-based):**
- Not being overweight/obese (metabolic health)
- Adequate protein (prevents muscle loss)
- Whole foods over processed
- Not overeating

**What probably doesn't matter:**
- Specific diet ideology (keto vs vegan vs Mediterranean)
- Meal timing (for most people)
- Supplements (mostly)

**Protein**: 1.6-2.2g/kg body weight for active individuals, especially important with age.

### 4. Metabolic Health

Key markers:
- Fasting glucose <100 mg/dL (ideally <90)
- Fasting insulin low
- Triglycerides <150 mg/dL
- HDL >40 (men), >50 (women)
- Waist circumference in healthy range

Metabolic dysfunction underlies most chronic disease.

### 5. Emotional/Social Health

Often overlooked in longevity discussions:
- Strong social connections = major mortality predictor
- Loneliness as harmful as smoking
- Purpose and meaning matter
- Stress management

## What Doesn't Work (or Is Overhyped)

### Supplements (Mostly)

- **Resveratrol**: Failed in human trials
- **NAD+ precursors (NMN, NR)**: Promising in mice, unclear in humans
- **Most antioxidants**: May actually interfere with exercise adaptation
- **Metformin for non-diabetics**: Controversial, may blunt exercise gains

**What might help:**
- Vitamin D (if deficient)
- Omega-3s (modest cardiovascular benefit)
- Creatine (muscle and brain health, good evidence)

### Extreme Interventions

- **Aggressive caloric restriction**: Hard to sustain, may lose muscle
- **Extended fasting**: Limited human longevity data
- **Cold exposure**: Benefits real but modest
- **Hyperbaric oxygen**: Expensive, unclear benefit

### The 80/20 of Longevity

80% of results come from:
1. Regular exercise (especially cardio + strength)
2. Not smoking
3. Moderate alcohol (or none)
4. Healthy body weight
5. Adequate sleep

Everything else is marginal optimization.

## Age-Specific Considerations

### 20s-30s: Building Foundation
- Establish exercise habits
- Build muscle mass (easier now than later)
- Develop VO2 max base
- Form healthy sleep habits

### 40s-50s: Maintenance and Prevention
- Preserve muscle mass (it's declining)
- Monitor metabolic markers
- Increase focus on stability/mobility
- Get baseline health screenings

### 60s+: Preservation and Function
- Strength training becomes even more critical
- Fall prevention is key
- Cognitive engagement
- Social connection
- May need to modify intensity, not stop

## Actionable Insights for yeww

### When to Surface This Knowledge

**Good triggers:**
- User asks about longevity, living longer, healthspan
- User is making long-term health decisions
- User asks "what should I focus on?"
- User is overwhelmed by conflicting health advice
- User is optimizing margins while ignoring basics

**Bad triggers:**
- User is in acute situation (injury, illness)
- User just wants to vent

### Example Conversations

**User asks what matters most:**
> "If I had to rank it: exercise (especially cardio + strength), sleep, and not carrying excess body fat. Those three things account for most of the longevity benefit. Everything else—supplements, biohacks, specific diets—is marginal compared to those basics."

**User focused on supplements:**
> "Supplements get a lot of attention but the evidence is pretty thin for most of them. The unsexy truth is that exercise, sleep, and not being overweight do way more than any pill. Are those dialed in?"

**User asks about Zone 2:**
> "Zone 2 is the sweet spot for building your aerobic base—hard enough to challenge your mitochondria, easy enough to do for long periods without burning out. It's the foundation that makes everything else work better. Can you hold a conversation? That's about the right intensity."

**User training only strength or only cardio:**
> "Both matter for longevity. Cardio (especially Zone 2) is the strongest mortality predictor—VO2 max beats everything else. But strength training preserves muscle mass, which you lose 3-8% per decade after 30. The combination is more powerful than either alone."

### Phrasing Guidelines

**Do say:**
- "The basics matter more than the biohacks"
- "Exercise is the closest thing to a longevity drug"
- "What matters is consistency over years"
- "Quality years, not just years"

**Don't say:**
- "This will add X years to your life" (can't promise)
- "You need to do X" (suggest, don't prescribe)
- Overly technical longevity jargon

## Summary

**The longevity prescription is simpler than the wellness industry suggests:**

1. **Exercise**: Zone 2 + strength + some intensity work
2. **Sleep**: 7-8 hours, consistent schedule
3. **Don't carry excess fat**: Metabolic health matters
4. **Don't smoke**: Obvious but crucial
5. **Moderate alcohol**: Or none
6. **Stay connected**: Relationships matter
7. **Manage stress**: Chronic stress accelerates aging

Everything else is optimization at the margins. Get the basics right first.
