## Core Principles

### The Training Adaptation Cycle

1. **Stress**: Training applies stress to the body
2. **Recovery**: Body repairs and adapts during rest
3. **Supercompensation**: Body becomes slightly stronger/fitter than before
4. **Repeat**: Progressive overload continues the cycle

**Key insight**: Adaptation happens during RECOVERY, not during training. Training is the stimulus; rest is when you get stronger.

### The Overtraining Spectrum

| State | Description | Recovery Time |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Acute fatigue** | Normal post-workout tiredness | Hours to 1-2 days |
| **Functional overreaching** | Planned, short-term performance dip | Days to 1-2 weeks |
| **Non-functional overreaching** | Unplanned stagnation/decline | 2-4 weeks |
| **Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)** | Systemic breakdown | Weeks to MONTHS |

OTS affects 20-60% of athletes at some point in their careers.

## Signs of Overtraining

### Early Warning Signs

- Workouts feel harder than they should at usual intensity
- Not making progress (plateau) or going backward
- Persistent muscle soreness beyond 72 hours
- Elevated resting heart rate (5-10+ bpm above baseline)
- Decreased HRV over several days/weeks
- Sleep disturbances despite being tired
- Increased irritability or mood changes
- Getting sick more often

### Red Flags (OTS)

- Chronic fatigue that rest doesn't fix
- Depression or loss of motivation
- Insomnia combined with exhaustion
- Frequent illness/infections
- Loss of appetite
- Decreased libido
- Performance declining for weeks despite rest

### The HRV Connection

- Elevated RHR + decreased HRV over 7-10 days = strong overtraining indicator
- HRV often drops before you consciously feel overtrained
- Monitor trends, not single days

## Training Balance: Cardio vs Strength

### Why You Need Both

**Cardio (especially Zone 2):**
- VO2 max = strongest mortality predictor
- Mitochondrial health and efficiency
- Cardiovascular protection
- Metabolic health

**Strength training:**
- Preserves muscle mass (lose 3-8% per decade after 30)
- Maintains bone density
- Prevents falls and maintains independence
- Metabolic benefits (muscle is metabolically active)

### The Longevity Training Framework

Based on Peter Attia and current research:

| Component | Weekly Target | Why |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| **Zone 2 cardio** | 150-180 min (3-4 sessions) | Mitochondrial health, VO2 max base |
| **Strength training** | 3 sessions | Muscle mass, bone density |
| **VO2 max intervals** | 1 session (20-30 min) | Push aerobic ceiling |
| **Mobility/flexibility** | 2-3 sessions | Injury prevention, longevity |

### Sample Week

- Monday: Lower body strength (45 min)
- Tuesday: Zone 2 cardio (45-60 min)
- Wednesday: Upper body strength (45 min)
- Thursday: Zone 2 + mobility (60 min)
- Friday: Full body strength (30 min)
- Saturday: VO2 max intervals (30 min)
- Sunday: Rest or gentle yoga

## Recovery Strategies

### Tier 1: Essential (Do These)

**1. Sleep**
- 7-9 hours
- Most powerful recovery tool
- Growth hormone peaks during deep sleep

**2. Nutrition**
- Adequate protein (1.6-2.2g/kg for active individuals)
- Carbs to replenish glycogen
- Don't chronically under-eat

**3. Rest Days**
- At least 1 full rest day per week
- Active recovery (walking, light movement) on other easy days
- Not every day should be hard

**4. Periodization**
- Deload week every 4-6 weeks (reduce volume 40-50%)
- Vary intensity across the week
- Build volume before intensity

### Tier 2: Helpful

**5. Hydration**
- Dehydration impairs recovery
- Monitor urine color (pale yellow = good)

**6. Stress management**
- Life stress adds to training stress
- High life stress = reduce training load

### Tier 3: Nice to Have

**7. Cold exposure**
- May reduce inflammation (but also blunts adaptation if done immediately post-workout)
- Better for acute recovery than chronic use

**8. Massage/foam rolling**
- Feels good, modest evidence for recovery
- Won't hurt

## When to Push vs Rest

### Green Light (Train Hard)

- HRV at or above baseline
- Rested and motivated
- No unusual soreness
- Sleep was good
- Life stress manageable

### Yellow Light (Train but Listen)

- HRV slightly below baseline
- Somewhat tired but not exhausted
- Mild lingering soreness
- Adequate sleep
- Consider moderate vs max effort

### Red Light (Rest or Very Easy)

- HRV significantly down for 2+ days
- Exhausted, no motivation
- Persistent soreness
- Poor sleep for multiple nights
- High life stress
- Early signs of illness

## Common Mistakes

### 1. "More is better"
**Reality**: Adaptation requires recovery. Training 7 days/week at high intensity = breakdown, not growth.

### 2. "No pain, no gain"
**Reality**: Discomfort during training is fine. Pain is a warning signal. Chronic soreness means inadequate recovery.

### 3. "I'll sleep when I'm dead"
**Reality**: Chronic sleep deprivation makes training counterproductive. You'll get weaker, not stronger.

### 4. "Rest days are lazy"
**Reality**: Rest days are when adaptation happens. Elite athletes take them seriously.

### 5. "I can train through illness"
**Reality**: Training while sick delays recovery and risks serious complications. Rest.

## Actionable Insights for yeww

### When to Surface This Knowledge

**Good triggers:**
- User training hard with no rest days
- User mentions persistent fatigue
- User's HRV declining over days
- User asks about training frequency
- User not seeing progress
- User coming back from injury/illness

**Bad triggers:**
- User just completed a great workout (celebrate first)
- User is already taking rest seriously

### Example Conversations

**User training every day:**
> "Training 7 days straight is a lot—your body adapts during rest, not during workouts. Even elite athletes take at least one full rest day. How are you feeling energy-wise?"

**User mentions persistent soreness:**
> "Soreness that lasts more than 72 hours usually means you're not recovering between sessions. Could be training volume, sleep, nutrition, or all three. When's your last rest day?"

**User's HRV trending down:**
> "Your HRV has been declining for a few days—that's often an early sign you're accumulating more stress than recovery. Might be worth a lighter week to let your system catch up."

**User asks about optimal training:**
> "For longevity, research points to: 3-4 hours of Zone 2 cardio, 3 strength sessions, and maybe one VO2 max interval session per week. Plus at least one full rest day. The balance between stress and recovery is where the magic happens."

### Phrasing Guidelines

**Do say:**
- "Adaptation happens during recovery"
- "How's your energy between sessions?"
- "When's your last rest day?"
- "Listen to what your body's telling you"

**Don't say:**
- "You're overtrained" (don't diagnose)
- "You should take X days off" (give info, let them decide)
- "That's too much/too little training" (individual variation)

## When to Defer

- Suspected injury (refer to physio/doctor)
- Overtraining syndrome symptoms (needs professional evaluation)
- Training for elite competition (needs a coach)
- Medical conditions affecting exercise capacity
